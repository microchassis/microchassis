# MicroChassis

MicroChassis is an opinionated implementation of the [Microservices Chassis Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservice-chassis.html) for .NET applications. Built for the enterprise it provides any organization with a standardized framework for structuring, preconfiguring and distributing dependencies that would usually handle cross-cutting concerns like logging, tracing, hosting etc. This would promote consistency, maintainability, and efficiency across all microservices while ensuring that each service is evolved independently. It would also allow developers to focus on the unique aspects of their services without being bogged down by underlying infrastructure.
